# Introduction {-}


Key to note is the data science process flow

1. Import the data
2. Wrangle (tidy + transform)
3. Visualisation
4. Models
5. Communication

> Note that **Programming** cuts across in all the steps

In addition to the above, in my industry, it sometimes looks like this:

`r knitr::include_graphics("./images/stat_model.JPG") `

And when there is predictive modlelling, the process flow can egt a little confusing:

`r knitr::include_graphics("./images/pred_model.JPG") `

*The order of notes follow the R4DS book not the data science workflow.*
